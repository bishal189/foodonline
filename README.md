Laboration 1
Environment & Tools

    Python Version: 3.11.4
    Git Version: 2.41.0
    Repository Platform: Bitbucket
    Branching Strategy: The assignment used a dedicated development branch laboration_1, which was merged into master upon completion.

Purpose

This study covers fundamentals surrounding basic data types, operators, and conditional logic, together with basic use of version control. The work conducted aims to produce a solution that conforms to the required specifications. The concrete goals for determining success in this study are:

    Isolating the main work to a dedicated development branch named laboration_1, which is merged into master upon submission.
    Adding the missing logic to the provided source file in compliance with the expected behavior as stated by the provided pseudo code.

Discussion

The primary focus of the assignment was to implement logic using basic data types, operators, and conditional statements. Working on this included:

    Setting up a new Git branch (laboration_1) to isolate the development work.
    Writing the necessary logic in the assignment.py file based on the provided pseudo code.
    Committing and pushing the changes regularly, ensuring the development branch remained synchronized with the remote repository.
    Lastly, merging the development branch into the master for submission.

Personal Reflections

This lab gave me hands-on experience with both Git and Python. Key takeaways include:

    Understanding the importance of branching for separate development.
    Writing clean, logical code and following the structure provided in the pseudo code.
    Gaining practical experience with Git commands like git checkout, git commit, and git merge.
    Learning how to avoid merge conflicts and maintain a clean commit history.

Conclusion

In conclusion, this assignment allowed me to strengthen my understanding of both fundamental programming concepts and version control using Git. The process of isolating development into a separate branch helped me appreciate the benefits of organized workflow and clear version management. By working through each step, I was able to implement the required logic, resolve any challenges that arose, and ensure that the final solution met the specifications provided in the pseudo code. This lab has not only deepened my technical skills but also reinforced the importance of best practices in software development.
